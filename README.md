# mazes

Maze generation algorithms in Java

Implemented algorithms:

- Aldous Broder
- Binary Tree (top-down and random)
- Eller's
- My own variation of Eller's growing the maze inside out
- Hunt-And-Kill
- Iterative random depth-first-search
- Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
- Prim Minimum Spanning Tree
- Random breadth-first-search
- Recursive depth-first-search
- Recursive division
- Wilson' algorithm (13 different variants)

Generation can be animated using eventing mechanism and grid rendering in JComponent.

Animated path finding (DFS and BFS)
